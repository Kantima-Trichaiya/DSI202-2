# 1. Abstract 
	This project presents a web-based application designed to support both the borrowing and donation of medical equipment. The primary objective is to facilitate equitable access to essential medical devices such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, walking aids, and other mobility supports without requiring significant financial investment, particularly during temporary or urgent periods of medical need.
	In addition to helping individuals in need, this platform provides an avenue for members of the community to donate their unused or surplus medical equipment. Such donations can then be recirculated to others, promoting sustainability and reducing medical waste. The system fosters a sense of community involvement, mutual support, and resource sharing, aligning with goals of social responsibility and circular economy principles.
Key features of the platform include:
•	User registration with the ability to select roles (borrower or donor).
•	Equipment listing, searching, filtering, and detailed browsing.
•	Rental functionality with duration selection and cart management.
•	Donation submission forms with status tracking.
•	A user-generated review and rating system to support informed decision-making.
•	Favorites management for quick access to frequently used items.
•	Automated reminders to ensure timely rental payments and returns.
	This platform is expected to offer substantial benefits to the community, particularly to elderly individuals, caregivers, patients recovering at home, and those with limited financial resources. By increasing the accessibility and circulation of medical equipment, the system supports both social equity and environmental sustainability.
