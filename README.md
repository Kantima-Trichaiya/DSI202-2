# Abstract

This project presents **Care Every Home**, a comprehensive web-based application designed to support both the borrowing and donation of essential medical equipment. Our primary goal is to provide equitable and affordable access to critical devices such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, walking aids, and other mobility supports—especially for individuals facing temporary or urgent medical needs without the burden of high upfront costs.

The platform addresses a significant gap in healthcare accessibility by allowing users to rent medical equipment for short-term use, avoiding the heavy financial strain of purchasing costly devices that may only be needed for a limited time. Additionally, the system encourages community participation by enabling members to donate unused or surplus medical equipment. These donated items are then recirculated, fostering sustainability and reducing medical waste, thereby supporting environmental responsibility and the principles of a circular economy.

Key features of the platform include:

- **User Registration and Role Selection:** Users can register and choose roles such as borrower or donor to tailor their experience.
- **Comprehensive Equipment Management:** Users can browse, search, filter, and view detailed information about medical equipment.
- **Flexible Rental System:** The platform supports rental duration selection, shopping cart management, and automated notifications.
- **Donation Submission and Tracking:** Donors can easily submit equipment donations with images and descriptions and monitor the status of their submissions.
- **User-Generated Reviews and Ratings:** A community-driven review system helps maintain transparency and improve service quality.
- **Favorites Management:** Users can bookmark frequently used or preferred items for quick access.
- **Automated Reminders:** The system sends timely notifications for rental payments and equipment return deadlines, ensuring smooth operations.

This application is designed to provide significant benefits to various groups, including elderly individuals, caregivers, patients recovering at home, and those with limited financial resources. By enhancing accessibility and promoting equipment sharing, Care Every Home supports social equity and environmental sustainability, helping to build a caring and inclusive community.
