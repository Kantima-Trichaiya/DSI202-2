# 1.Abstract
	This project presents a web based application designed to support the borrowing and donation of medical equipment. The primary objective is to facilitate access to essential medical devices such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, and mobility aids without requiring significant financial investment, particularly during periods of medical need. Additionally, the platform provides an opportunity for individuals to donate unused medical equipment, allowing such resources to be reused and circulated within the community.
	The system offers key features including user registration (with roles as borrower or donor), equipment browsing and rental, donation submissions, favorites management, a review and rating system, and automated rental payment reminders.
This platform is expected to offer substantial benefits to the community, especially to elderly individuals, patients, and those with limited financial resources, by increasing accessibility to medical equipment and promoting resource efficiency through reuse.
